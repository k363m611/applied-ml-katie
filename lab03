# Lab 3 â€“ Building a Classifier (Titanic Dataset)

## Overview
In this lab, we build and evaluate different classification models using the Titanic dataset. We:

1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Split into training and testing sets
3. Train multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, etc.)
4. Compare their performance
5. Summarize our findings

## Files
- `README.md`: This file
- `ml03_Nadeem.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with our analysis and models

## Steps to Run
1. Open `ml03_Nadeem.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run each cell from top to bottom.
3. Check the final tables or metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.) to see which model performed best.
